# What is functional programming?
 a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions

# Pure Function

### The definition of a pure function is: The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in. It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a program's execution. It must only depend on its input arguments.

# What are the benefits of a pure function?
### Pure functions are much easier to read and reason about. All relevant inputs and dependencies are provided as parameters, so no effects are observed that alter variables outside of the set of inputs. This means that we can quickly understand a function and its dependencies, just by reading the function's declaration.

# What is immutability?
data cannot change its structure or the data in it. It’s setting a value on a variable that cannot change

# What is Referential transparency?
the fact that an expression, in a program, may be replaced by its value (or anything having the same value)

# What is a module?
a software component or part of a program that contains one or more routines. … Modules make a programmer’s job easy

# What does the word ‘require’ do?
 is intended to add separate pieces of code (“modules”) to the current scope, a feature 

# How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
By using import name and the path of the module
