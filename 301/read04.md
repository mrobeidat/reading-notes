### Use the ternary operator to simplify your if-else statements that are used to assign values to variables. The ternary operator is commonly used when assigning post data or validating forms.

# Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

(```  if(x===y)```{
 ```console.log(true);```
  } ```else {```
 ```console.log(false);```
  }```)

## Answer : 

(```x==y``` ? ```value if console.log(true) : value if console.log(false)```)
