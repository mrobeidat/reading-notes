# Expressions and operators
#### Expressions perform specific actions, based on an operator, with one or two operands. An operand can be a constant, a variable or a function result. Operators are arithmetic, logical, and relational. As with C, some operators vary in functionality according to the data type of the operands specified in the expression.

#### An operator excutes some operation on single or multiple operands and return with a results.
 
## The types of operators are :

1. **Comparison Operators** which are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values. for ex : (< , > , = , !=, ...)
2. **Assignment operators** which are used to assign values to variables. for ex : ( += , =)
3. **Arithmetic operators** which takes numerical values (either literals or variables) 




# Loops and iteration

#### Loops are used to perform a set of statements more than once until a the right condition is satisfied.

**## In Java we have three types of basic loops:**
* While : Java while loop is using a boolean condition and it excuted repeatedly that will allows code to be executed a few times.

* Do-while : This do-while loop is executed at least once because condition is checked after loop body.

* For loop : a little bit the same as other loops but the difference are they typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop.
