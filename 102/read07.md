># Expressions and operators

**An expression** is any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a single value. The value may be a number, a string, or a logical value. 

#### For Instance, there are **two types** of expressions: 

**1.** Those that assign a value to a variable, 

**2.** Those that simply have a value. For example, **X=9**

**Regarding operators** there are three types of operators: 

1. Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example **var x = 100 + 50;**
2. String: evaluates to a character string, for ex :**"Ali" or "123"**
3. Logical: considered as **true or false**

># Functions 
 
**When you write a code, you need to do repeat the same action in more than one place, so instead, you can use a function to wrap that code and reuse it**

#### Java script provides many built-in functions for instance, alert() and console.log().
#### So when you need to declare a function you need to use **function** word followed by the name of the function for ex:
 
**function square(number){**

**return number * number;
}**
