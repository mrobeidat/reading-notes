# HTML TEXT

* ## What do we mean by headings ?

### A HTML heading or HTML **H** tag can be defined as a title or a subtitle which you want to display on the webpage. **h1** is the largest heading tag and **h6** is the smallest one. So **H1** is used for most important heading and **h6** is used for least important

* ## Paragraphs 

### The "p" HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

* ## superscript & subscript 

### A subscript or superscript is a character (such as a number or letter) that is set slightly below or above the normal line of type, respectively. It is usually smaller than the rest of the text. Subscripts appear at or below the baseline, while superscripts are above.

### (br/) if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag (br /). you can also add a horizontal rule between sections using the (hr /) tag.


* ## Semantic Markup

### Semantic markup is a way of writing and structuring your HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) so that it reinforces the semantics, or meaning, of the content rather than its appearance. ... When you write a paragraph, mark it with a paragraph tag (p).

* ## Strong & Emphasis

### **(Strong)** the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis and the browser will show the content of it in bold. while the **(em)** element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence and the browser will show the content of it in italic.

* ## Abbreviations & Acronyms

### (abbr) If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the **abbr** element can be used. A titleattribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.

* ## Author or details

### **Address** element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.
