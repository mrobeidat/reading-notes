* ## What do we mean by headings ?

### A HTML heading or HTML **H** tag can be defined as a title or a subtitle which you want to display on the webpage. **h1** is the largest heading tag and **h6** is the smallest one. So **H1** is used for most important heading and **h6** is used for least important

>> # What is CSS ?

### Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, is an integral part of the modern web development process. It is a highly effective HTML tool that provides easy control over layout and presentation of website pages by separating content from design.

## Merging CSS & HTML with rules

### CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a **selector** and a **declaration**.

#### The CSS job here is to affect the style of the website and how it should be look like.
#### So if we want to make a change on a specific element for HTML using CSS, all we have to do is type the tag of the element inside the CSS then we should put the tags of CSS wich will change the color or style of HTML element inside these curly brackets { }.

## How to use CSS outside the HTML code (external)?

### All we have to do is link the CSS file with HTML using a specfic syntax code inside the html file to link them together as shown below :

## How to use CSS inside the HTML code (internal)?

### An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page. An internal CSS is defined in the (head) section of an HTML page, within a (style) element as shown below  :

## Why using external style sheet better than internal one ?

##### * Since the CSS code is in a separate document, your HTML files will have a cleaner structure and are smaller in size.
##### * You can use the same . css file for multiple pages.
