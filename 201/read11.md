* ### How Flash Works?

#### Whether you are creating an animation or a media player in Flash, the files you put on your website are referred to as Flash movies. If you want to create your own Flash movie, you need to purchase the Flash authoring environment from Adobe.To view Flash, browsers need to use a plugin (an extra piece of software that runs in the browser) called the Flash Player. Statistics commonly indicate that 98% of browsers on desktop computers have the Flash plugin installed. (The percentage of mobiles and tablets with it is much less.)
