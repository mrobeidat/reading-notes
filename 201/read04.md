>> #Links in HTML

#### Links are a vital part of HTML and the very reason why the WWW exists. The basic function of a link is to make a reference, from an HTML document to a resource, which can be itself another document. In other words, a link defines a relationship between two resources on the web, so anything between (a) tag considered as a link.


## We can use them in : 

* #### links to other sites.
* #### links to other pages in the same site.

## Directory Structure:

#### The directory structure is the organization of files into a hierarchy of folders.

## Relative URLS

#### Relative links show the path to the file or refer to the file itself. A relative URL is useful within a site to transfer a user from point to point within the same domain.

## Containing Elements 

#### if one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

## The position : 

1. Normal flow (position : static)
2. Relative positioning (position : relative)
3. Absolute positioning (position : absolute)
4. Fixed positioning (position : fixed)

## Screen sizes :

#### Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

## Screen resolution :

#### Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

## Page Sizes :

#### Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide.

## How do you change the page size in HTML?

1. Set the height and width of a (div) element: div { height: 200px; width: 50%;
2. Set the height and width of another (div) element: div { height: 100px; width: 500px; 
3. This (div) element has a height of 100 pixels and a max-width of 500 pixels: div { max-width: 500px; height: 100px;

>> # Java script : Fucnction & methods & objects

#### Java is an object-oriented programming language. ... For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

## Pair programming 

#### is an important technique for developing higher quality code, faster while also reducing risk and spreading knowledge in an organization. With pair programming, two software developers work on one computer, collaborating on the same design, algorithm, code, or test.


## Reasons for pair programming 

1. Onboard a junior developer:The most common usage is a junior programmer pairing with a senior one.

2. Build up self-confidence: Pair programming is a good practice to grow as a cohesive dev team. You want juniors to be more effective and expect someday they’ll be able to handle stories by their own, without systematically requiring you to fix everything afterwards. For this to happen, they first need to feel they are key elements of the project and team.

3. Improve code quality: Pair programming allows to share consistent coding practices between team members. When you expose some new way to arrange the project’s code during a meeting, people might not be as receptive as you thought they were
