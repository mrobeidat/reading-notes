>> # HTML Lists

#### HTML lists are used to present list of information in well formed and semantic way. There are three different types of list in HTML and each one has a specific purpose and meaning. Unordered list â€” Used to create a list of related items, in no particular order.

## * Their types: 

* **Ordered lists** : created with the (**ol**)element and In this type, the list items are numbered with upper case roman numbers. In this type, the list items are numbered with lower case roman numbers. In this type, the list items are numbered with upper case letters.

* **unordered list** :created with the (**ul**) element and these are sometimes called bulleted lists because the default visual appearance of an unordered list is to have small bullet icons in front of the list items. This type of list is best used when the order of the items isn't salient.

>> # HTML Boxes 

## * Box dimentions **(Height and width)**

#### The box-dimention property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height. If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height: Both divs are the same size now!

* ## Over flowing content

The overflow property specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box. This property specifies whether to clip content or to add scrollbars when an element's content is too big to fit in a specified area. Note: The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.

* ## Change In-line Block display

#### A block-level element always starts on a new line. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not. The <div> element is a block-level element.

* ## CSS3 Border images

#### If you don't want the border applied to the last (when using background-position: right; ) or first (for background-position: left; ) element in your menu then try the :last-child and :first-child selectors. You can set custom border size. Top, left and bottom will be 0px and set a border-image

* ##  How to make an array?

1. You must declare a variable of the desired array type.
2. You must allocate the memory that will hold the array using new, and assign it to the array variable. Therefor, in Java all arrays are dynamically allocated.

* ## SWITCH STATEMENTS

### It's a multi-way branch statement. It provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression. Basically, the expression can be byte, short, char, and int primitive data types.

* ## Loops : 

### There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements. 

### Loops are control structures used to repeat a given section of code a certain number of times or until a particular condition is met. Visual Basic has three main types of loops: for.. next loops, do loops and while loops.

* ## KEY LOOP CONCEPTS 

### For ex : First step In for loop, initialization happens first and only one time, which means that the initialization part of for loop only executes once. Second step: Condition in for loop is evaluated on each iteration, if the condition is true then the statements inside for loop body gets executed.
