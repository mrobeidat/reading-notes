# About CSS 
#### CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.

>> ## CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

1. Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
2. Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.
3. External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.

>> # Applying color to HTML elements using CSS : 

Colors are specified using predefined color names.

#### when it comes to the goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.
