## The Advice: Communicate! 

## What Do You Mean Communicate?

### First, Restate the Question 

*Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation.* 

*The interview should give you affirmation or, perhaps, your understanding is incorrect and they will help you understand. There is no situation in which restating the problem will hurt you — it shows you can articulate a problem and gives you time to think it through a bit while you discuss. Furthermore, starting the discussion this way will help quell some nerves that might otherwise manifest while trying to solve the actual challenge.* 

### Ask About Edge Cases 

*It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them.*

### Ask About Test Cases 

*This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. But it’s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think “ah, this candidate knows about testing!”*

### Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense 

*you don’t actually want to start writing code in an actual language. You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic. Instead, let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later.*

### Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good 

*You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in. If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief. If they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudocode for now.*

## Stuck? Ask for Help! 

**If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally.**

## Bonus: Communicating Prior to the Interview 

**You should have a human resources or interview point of contact prior to the interview. Are you curious whether there will be a coding portion of the interview? Ask them! Furthermore, you can ask if there is anything in particular you should prepare.**

> # 7 tips to ace a programming interview

## 1- Take a few minutes.

*Speaking as an interview coach, this is one misstep that I see all the time during mock interviews.*

*Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.*

*Shut your eyes, stare at the ceiling, scribble on the whiteboard — whatever it takes. Think through the basics of the problem, and decide on an approach. Then re-engage the interviewer, and let him know what you’ve concluded. Don’t forget to provide your reasoning!*

## 2- Write down the steps of the solution.

*just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.*

* Start at middle of array.

* Keep variables tracking left and right boundaries of search area.

* If value equal to search_val, return true.

* If left and right boundaries are adjacent, return false.

* If value bigger than search_val, go halfway towards left boundary, and move the right boundary along with us.

* If value smaller than search_val, go halfway towards right boundary, and move the left boundary along with us.

## 3- Write pseudocode first.

*writing the code by writing some pseudocode.*

## 4- Don’t sweat the small stuff.

*Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet. They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.*

## 5- Sit down. Be humble.

*A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess.*

## 6- Come prepared.

*When it comes to programming interviews, you want to be ready, you have to put in the time. It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards. In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success. And afterwards, regardless of the outcome, knowing that you could not have reasonably done more to prepare helps you feel proud of your work and start moving towards your next goal.*

*make sure you get enough HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat).*

## 7- Review your work.

*You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution.*

*if you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review. Show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, high-quality work, and that they can trust you to do so without being prompted.*
