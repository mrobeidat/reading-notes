# A summary about Markdown:  
### Markdown is used in many different sites, such as, GitHub, GitBook, Reddit and many other websites. However, Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). 

### The idea behind Markdownâ€™s formatting syntax is to make the text as readable as possible. In addition, files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.

### GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. GitHub is a very important and useful community to get involved in and most tech companies now use it in their workflow

### GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.
