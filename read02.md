# Remote repository

#### About 90% of version control related work happens in the local repository: staging, committing, viewing the status or the log/history, etc. Moreover, if you're the only person working on your project, chances are you'll never need to set up a remote repository.

#### In addition, a remote repository doesn't have such a working directory: **it only consists of the bare**"**.git"** repository folder.

## **The features:** 
1. *Contains branches*
2. *Commits*
3. *Tags*
